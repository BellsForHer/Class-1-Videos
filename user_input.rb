# 1. Create New directory called "Area_Of_Rectangle"
# 2. Create a file called "main.rb"
# 3. You will need to write a program that prompts the user for  input for width and height
# 4. multiply them to get the area and display the result in a message.
# ex.
# - Enter width:
# - 4
# - Enter height: 
# - 5
# - The area is 20

# puts "Enter width:"
# puts "Enter height"
# width = gets.chomp
# height = gets.chomp

# area = width * height

# puts "The area is #{area}"
